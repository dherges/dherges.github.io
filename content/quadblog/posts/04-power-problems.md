Well, it took me some time to get going again. I had some trouble powering the Pixhawk
from the LiPo battery. That was really weird since the Pixhawk did start up when it was
connected to USB power. Also, the Pixhawk did drive the motors as long it was connected
to the LiPo battery and USB power. However, as soon as it was connected only to the LiPo
battery it didn't start up.

After some [help in the px4users group][1] and a multimeter (again, that was borrowed
from a friend) I figured out that the power module was faulty and asked for a replacement.

When the new power module arrived yesterday, I immediately tried that out and
– *simsalabim* – it works!
