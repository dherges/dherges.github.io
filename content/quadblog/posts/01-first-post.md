This is my first post!

Holy guacamole! I tried to set-up my GitHub pages with a simple blog and I tried to do
so with [Assemble](http://assemble.io/). Well, it took me almost two days to puzzle
things together, but yeah, finally, there is a statically assembled site with a custom
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) style, and blog posts written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) language. That was quite some
effort!

So what the heck is this blog all about?

Well, put together a Motorola Defy that still runs Android Gingerbread, a 3DR Pixhawk,
and a DJI Flamewheel set and there will be a Quadcopter in the end. Maybe. :-)
